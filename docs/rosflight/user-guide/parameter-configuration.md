# Parameters

The ROSflight firmware has several dozen parameters which it uses to customize performance. Parameters are considered semi-static variables. That is, parameters do not change during flight, but they may change between vehicles. Examples of parameters you may wish to change are:

* Fixed-wing vehicle flag
* PID gains
* Mixer choice
* IMU low-pass filter constant
* RC receiver type (PPM or SBUS)

and so on. Access to all parameters is enabled via ROS services advertised by `rosflight_io` while the flight controller is connected.

## Parameter Interface

### Getting Parameter Values

Sometimes it is handy to ask the flight controller what the current value of a parameter is. This is accomplished using the `param_get` service. As an example, let's retrieve the roll angle controller proportional (P) gain.

```
rosservice call /param_get PID_ROLL_ANG_P
```

You should get a response similar to the following (this happens to be the default value with floating-point error):

```
exists: True
value: 0.15000000596
```

### Changing Parameters

Parameters are changed via the `param_set` service. As an example, let's change the roll angle controller P gain. (I will assume that the flight controller is connected and `rosflight_io` is running in the root namespace.)

```
rosservice call /param_set PID_ROLL_ANG_P 0.08
```

You should get a prompt from `rosflight_io` saying
```
[ INFO] [1491672408.585339558]: Parameter PID_ROLL_ANG_P has new value 0.08
[ WARN] [1491672408.585508849]: There are unsaved changes to onboard parameters
```

Notice that the parameters have been set, but not saved. Parameter changes take effect immediately, however they will not persist over a reboot unless you *write* them to the non-volatile memory. This brings us to the next task.

### Writing Parameters

To ensure that parameter values persist between reboots, you must write the parameters to the non-volatile memory. This is done by calling `param_write`

```
rosservice call /param_write
```

`rosflight_io` should then respond with
```
[ INFO] [1491672597.123201952]: Param write succeeded
[ INFO] [1491672597.123452908]: Onboard parameters have been saved
```

!!! important
    It is highly recommended that you write parameters before arming and flying the vehicle. Among other things, this will ensure that in the rare case that a hard fault is encountered and the flight controller must reboot during flight, the correct configuration will be loaded on reboot.

!!! error
    Parameter writing can only happen if the flight controller is disarmed. If the param write failed for some reason, you may want to make sure your FC is disarmed and try again.

### Backing Up and Loading Parameters from File

It is good practice to backup your parameter configuration in case you have to re-flash your firmware or you want to share configurations between vehicles. We can do this via the `param_save_to_file` and `param_load_from_file` services.

First, let's back up our current parameter configuration:

```
rosservice call /param_save_to_file ~/parameters.yml
```

Parameters are saved in YAML format. You must also specify the absolute file name of where you would like your parameters to be saved. The current active set of parameters will be saved, regardless of what is saved in non-volatile memory on the flight controller.

Now, let's say we want to re-load this parameter file
```
rosservice call /param_load_from_file ~/parameters.yml
```
Again, you must specify the absolute file name of the file to be loaded.


## Fixed-Wing Parameter Configuration

Because ROSflight ships with default parameters for multirotors, you will probably want to change the following parameters if you want to fly a fixed-wing aircraft.
