# Getting Started

Reading through the pages in this user guide in order should provide you with the information you need to get a vehicle flying with ROSflight. The following is a summary of the steps you'll need to follow to get your vehicle set up, with links to the corresponding documentation pages:

  1. [Hardware setup](hardware-setup.md): Set up your hardware (fixed-wing or multirotor platform, flight controller, and companion computer)
  2. [Flight controller setup](flight-controller-setup.md): Flash your flight controller with the latest ROSflight firmware.
  3. [RC Configuration](rc-configuration.md): Set up your RC transmitter.
  4. [ROS2 setup](ros2-setup.md): Set up ROS2 on your companion computer.
  5. [Parameter configuration](parameter-configuration.md): Configure the flight controller for your setup. The configuration checklists below should help guide you through this process.
  6. [Preflight checks](preflight-checks.md): Run through your preflight checks
  7. [Improving firmware performance](improving-firmware-performance.md) (multirotors only): Tune the firmware attitude controller gains
  8. [Autonomous flight](autonomous-flight.md) (optional): Set up autonomous flight via offboard control

## Configuration Checklist

The following checklists should help you get a new vehicle set up for the first time. This checklist assumes that your [hardware is already set up correctly](hardware-setup.md).

### General Setup

  1. Set the `FIXED_WING` parameter (`1` if a fixed-wing, `0` if a multirotor)
  2. Set the `RC_TYPE` parameter (`0` if PPM, `1` if SBUS)
  3. Set the `PRIMARY_MIXER` parameter to the appropriate value described in the [Hardware Setup](hardware-setup.md) page
  4. Set the `MOTOR_PWM_UPDATE` parameter (typically `490` for SimonK ESCs, `50` for standard servos)
  5. Make sure your [RC transmitter is set up correctly](rc-configuration.md)
  6. Set up your RC switches
      * If you want to arm/disarm using a switch, set the `ARM_CHANNEL` parameter to the appropriate channel (0-indexed)
      * If you want to use a switch to enable RC override, set the `RC_ATT_OVRD_CHN` and `RC_THR_OVRD_CHN` parameters to the appropriate channel(s) (0-indexed). If you want complete control (attitude and throttle) when you flip the switch, set both these parameters to the same channel.
  7. Calibrate your IMU: start `rosflight_io`, then run `ros2 service call /calibrate_imu std_srvs/srv/Trigger`
  8. Complete the multirotor-specific or fixed-wing-specific checklist below
  9. Save the parameters (`ros2 service call /param_write std_srvs/srv/Trigger`)
  10. You'll probably want to save a backup of your parameters (call `ros2 service call /param_save_to_file rosflight_msgs/srv/ParamFile "{filename: "params.yml"}"`)
  11. Make sure you run through the [Preflight Checklist](preflight-checks.md) before flying

### Multirotor-specific Setup

!!! danger
    **IMPORTANT:** Remove all props from the vehicle when calibrating ESCs!!!

  1. Calibrate ESCs
      1. Make sure `MOTOR_MIN_PWM` and `MOTOR_MAX_PWM` are correct (usually `1000` and `2000`)
      2. Set `PRIMARY_MIXER` param to `0` (ESC calibration mixer)
      3. Set `ARM_SPIN_MOTORS` to `0`
      4. Perform ESC calibration. For standard ESCs:

          1. With power disconnected from the motors, arm the flight controller
          2. Set throttle to maximum
          3. Connect power to the motors
          4. Drop the throttle to minimum

      5. Set the `PRIMARY_MIXER` parameter back to the appropriate value for your vehicle (see the [Hardware Setup](hardware-setup.md#motor-layouts) page)
      6. Set `ARM_SPIN_MOTORS` back to `1`

  2. The `ARM_SPIN_MOTORS` parameter should be set to `1` so the motors spin slowly when armed. The idle throttle setting can be adjusted with the `MOTOR_IDLE_THR` parameter.
  3. You'll most likely want to set the `CAL_GYRO_ARM` param to `1` to enable calibrating gyros before arming
  4. Set the `RC_ATT_MODE` parameter to set RC control mode (`0` for rate mode, `1` for angle mode [default])
  5. Set torque offsets as described in the [RC trim calculation](improving-firmware-performance.md#rc-trim) section of the Improving Firmware Performance page
  6. Set the `FAILSAFE_THR` parameter to specify the throttle level the MAV will hold if the transmitter disconnects. Set the parameter to `0` if you just want the MAV to drop, otherwise determine the amount of throttle required to hover the MAV and set the parameter comfortably below that. DO NOT set it above, as this will result in a runaway MAV. We recommended that you test the throttle level in an enclosed space by powering off the transmitter while hovering, if you set this parameter above 0.
  6. Tune the controller gains as described in the [Multirotor gain tuning](improving-firmware-performance.md#gain-tuning) section of the Improving Firmware Performance page

### Fixed-Wing-Specific Setup

  1. Reverse servo directions if necessary using the `AIL_REV`, `ELEVATOR_REV`, and `RUDDER_REV` parameters (`1` to reverse, `0` to keep current direction)
  1. You'll most likely want to set the `ARM_SPIN_MOTORS` parameter to `0` so that the prop doesn't spin at a minimum throttle setting when you arm, especially if you'll be doing hand launching
