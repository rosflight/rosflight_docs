# Transitioning from Sim to Hardware

## ROSplane Sim2Real
ROSflight simulation allows users to insert aerodynamic models of their aircraft and test in simulation.
This is useful for controller tuning and validating new functionality in sim before hardware tests.

The following pages provide a step-by-step user guide with information on how to use XFlyer5 and OpenVSP to compute the aerodynamic control and stability derivatives required for the ROSflight aerodynamic model.
These derivatives are found in a parameter file.


You can also download this user manual as a single file and then open it in your browser to render it.
