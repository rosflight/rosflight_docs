# Transitioning from Sim to Hardware

## ROSplane Sim2Real
ROSflight simulation allows users to insert aerodynamic models of their aircraft and test in simulation.
This is useful for controller tuning and validating new functionality in sim before hardware tests.

See the attached user guide for information on how to use XFlyer5 and OpenVSP to compute the aerodynamic control and stability derivatives required for the ROSflight aerodynamic model.
These derivatives are found in a parameter file.
