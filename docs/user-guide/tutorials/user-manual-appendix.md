#### Cm/Alpha Stability


The Cm (center of mass) vs. Alpha curve must have a negative slope to be stable. It also should cross the positive x-axis to be stable.  

  

 If the slope is not positive or if the line does not cross the positive x-axis, then the aircraft will not be able to naturally hold level flight.

#### Neutral Point


The neutral point (NP) is the aerodynamic center of the entire aircraft â€” the point along the longitudinal axis where the pitching moment doesn't change with angle of attack.  

  

 If the center of gravity (CG) is ahead of the NP, the aircraft is statically stable.  

 If the CG is behind the NP, the aircraft is unstable.  

![neutral point formula](../../assets/user_manual_assets/appendix%20pictures/neutral%20point%20formula.svg)
  

 In Xflr5, you can find the calculated neutral point in the plane viewer tab after performing a basic aerodynamic analysis. You can also find the NP in the coefficient viewer window below the list of analyses after a stability analysis.  

  

 In OpenVSP, the neutral point can be found at the bottom right of the .stab file after a stability analysis is completed.  

![aerodynamics 3](../../assets/user_manual_assets/appendix%20pictures/aerodynamics%203.svg)
 The neutral point can also be found in both Xflr5 and OpenVSP by finding the CG location at which the Cm vs. Alpha curve has a flat slope.

#### Static Margin


Static margin is a measure of how stable an aircraft is. A higher SM means the aircraft will more quickly stabilize itself from disturbances, which usually also results in a lower maneuverability.  

  

 The static margin for most commercial and hobbyist aircraft is between 5-15%. 5-10% is more maneuverable, and 10-20% is more stable.

#### Flight Speed


The y-intercept of a velocity vs. alpha chart will show you the steady flight speed at any alpha.

#### Aircraft Trimming


A Cm vs. alpha chart x-intercept shows the trimmed angle of an aircraft.  

![aerodynamics 7](../../assets/user_manual_assets/appendix%20pictures/aerodynamics%207.svg)



#### Glide Ratio


A glide ratio compares how far an aircraft can fly compared to how far it will fall.  

  

 The CL/CD vs. Cm chart y-intercept shows the glide ratio.  

![aerodynamics 8](../../assets/user_manual_assets/appendix%20pictures/aerodynamics%208.svg)



#### Root Locus Stability


The root locus chart in the Xflr5 viewer shows the stability response of an aircraft.  

  

 The roots show stable / oscillatory characteristics.  

  

 If the roots are farther left, the aircraft is more stable. Farther from the x-axis = more oscillation.

### How to Find the Best Stability and Control Derivatives


You should actuate only one group of control surfaces per stability analysis. For this reason, you will most likely need to run several stability analyses.  

  

 Example: have one stability analysis with ailerons activated to get the aileron control derivatives, and another analysis to get the elevator control derivatives.  

![finding derivatives 1](../../assets/user_manual_assets/appendix%20pictures/finding%20derivatives%201.svg)
 The .flt file contains all of the stability derivatives, but does not contain the control derivatives. The drag coefficients in here seem to be the most accurate.  

![finding derivatives 2](../../assets/user_manual_assets/appendix%20pictures/finding%20derivatives%202.svg)
  

 In Xflr5, the stability and control derivatives can be found in the output viewer after a stability analysis is completed.  

  

 Select an analysis from the list at the top left and the derivatives will appear below.
