# Tutorials for ROSflight

The tutorials in this section are designed to help you get started using ROSflight, ROScopter, and ROSplane in a simulation environment.
They provide step-by-step guidance on launching the simulation, controlling vehicles manually, and running autonomous missions using one of the autonomy stacks (ROScopter or ROSplane).
This will enable you to start testing your own code in sim.

By following these tutorials, you will learn how to:

- Launch and interact with the ROSflight simulation
- Manually control simulated vehicles using a joystick or keyboard
- Run fixed-wing (ROSplane) and multirotor (ROScopter) simulations
- Understand basic communication between simulation and autonomy stack modules

These tutorials are ideal for:

- First-time users wanting to explore ROSflight without hardware
- Developers prototyping vehicle behaviors in a safe, repeatable environment
- Students and researchers learning about flight control, estimation, and planning

## Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, make sure you have completed the following from the [Installation for Sim](../installation-sim.md) guide:

- Installed **ROS2 Humble** (on Ubuntu 22.04)
- Set up the **ROSflight simulation environment**
- Built the workspace successfully with `colcon`
- Verified that you can run simple ROS2 nodes and source the ROS2 environment
