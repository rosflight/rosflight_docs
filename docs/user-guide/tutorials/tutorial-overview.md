# Tutorials for ROSflight

!!! tip "New to ROSflight?"

    If you are new to ROSflight, start here!
    We recommend going through the tutorials from [Setting up ROSflight Sim](./setting-up-rosflight-sim.md) through [Tuning performance](./tuning-performance-in-sim.md).
    After you have finished those, you should be ready to start flying your own code in sim.

The tutorials in this section are designed to help you get started using ROSflight, ROScopter, and ROSplane in a simulation environment.
They provide step-by-step guidance on launching the simulation, controlling vehicles manually, and running autonomous missions using one of the autonomy stacks (ROScopter or ROSplane).
This will enable you to start testing your own code in sim.

By following these tutorials, you will learn how to:

- Launch and interact with the ROSflight simulation
- Manually control simulated vehicles using a joystick or keyboard
- Run fixed-wing (ROSplane) and multirotor (ROScopter) simulations
- Understand basic communication between simulation and autonomy stack modules

## Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, make sure you have completed the [Installation for Sim](../installation/installation-sim.md) guide.
