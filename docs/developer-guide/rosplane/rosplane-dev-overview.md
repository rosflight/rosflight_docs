# ROSplane Developer Guide Overview

The purpose of the this section is to provide detailed information on each of the components of ROSplane, as shown in the below figure.
It is written with the intent that a user might know how to change each component of ROSplane, not only just how to use it.

Note that the sections not part of ROSplane are not included in this section (ROSflight firmware, physical aircraft setup, etc.).

Each of these components are described in detail in this section, but the implementation is not fully described.
Please refer to the code for more detailed information on the actual implementation of each of the elements shown above.

## Contributing to ROSplane

If you create a new "module" when using ROSplane for your application, please contribute back!
While changes won't be included in the core ROSplane stack (see [ROSflight Vision](../../index.md#our-vision)), we hope to build a repository of modules and projects that have been created by others.
Doing this is also an effective way to share your work and help others build on it.
