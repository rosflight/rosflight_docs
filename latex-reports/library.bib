abstract = {Complementary filter-based algorithms for attitude estimation seek to minimize the short-comings associated with the low-cost MEMS sensors and low-power embedded processors that are frequently used in unmanned aerial vehicles. This paper explores the performance impact of three different ingredients for attitude estimation within the complementary filter framework: 1) kinematic propagation, 2) attitude representation, and 3) the assumptions on the behavior of the angular rate vector between samples. Forward Euler integration and matrix exponential propagation methods are compared within several attitude representations, namely the direction cosine matrix (DCM), quaternion, Euler angle, and the angle-axis schemes. Assumptions of constant, linear, and quadratic angular velocities between samples are also examined. The resulting algorithms are evaluated from the points of view of accuracy, computational load, and noise response. Tests using analytic inputs as well as real data within the framework of the SLUGS autopilot are performed to evaluate algorithm performance. The results of the experiments indicate that by combining matrix exponential propagation with a quaternion representation of attitude high accuracy can be obtained with a standard processor.},

@article{Mahony2007,
abstract = {This paper considers the problem of obtaining good attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are characterised by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO(3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias on-line. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases on-line. The performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle},
